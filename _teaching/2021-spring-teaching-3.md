This course explores the fundamental unit of life, focusing on the structural and functional organization of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as well as the molecular mechanisms governing cellular homeostasis.

### Objectives
To analyze the relationship between cellular structure and function, understanding the biochemical and molecular processes that allow cells to interact with their environment and maintain life.

### Key Topics
* **Cell Theory & Evolution:** History of cell biology, prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic organization, and endosymbiotic theory.
* **Chemical Components of the Cell:** Structure and function of water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.
* **Biological Membranes:** Composition, fluid mosaic model, and transport mechanisms (passive and active).
* **Cytoplasmic Organelles:** Structure and function of the nucleus, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes.
* **Energy Metabolism:** Introduction to mitochondria and chloroplasts as energy conversion centers.

### Methodology
Combines theoretical discussion with microscopy workshops and laboratory activities focused on identifying cellular structures and understanding physiological processes.
