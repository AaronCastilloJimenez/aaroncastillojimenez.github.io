This course focuses on analytical tools for biological and health sciences.

### Objectives
To master statistical methods for data collection, organization, and interpretation to support evidence-based decision-making in biology and public health.

### Key Topics
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Variable types, frequency tables, measures of central tendency (mean, median), and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
* **Probability Theory:** Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions applied to health data.
* **Sampling:** Random sampling techniques, confidence intervals, and sample size determination.
* **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis testing ($H_0$ vs. $H_a$), Type I and II errors, and Z/t-tests for mean comparisons.

### Methodology
The course combines theoretical seminars with practical workshops, emphasizing data analysis through computational tools for clinical and biological datasets.
