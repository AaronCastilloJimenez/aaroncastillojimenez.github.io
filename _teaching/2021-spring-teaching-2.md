This course provides a comprehensive foundation in genetic principles, covering molecular, classical, and population genetics within the context of health and biological sciences.

### Objectives
To understand the mechanisms of inheritance, gene expression, and genetic variation, and to apply this knowledge to solve problems in human health and evolutionary biology.

### Key Topics
* **Molecular Basis of Inheritance:** DNA structure, replication, transcription, and translation.
* **Mendelian & Post-Mendelian Genetics:** Laws of inheritance, allelic interactions, and complex traits.
* **Cytogenetics:** Chromosome structure, mitosis, meiosis, and chromosomal abnormalities.
* **Population Genetics:** Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, evolutionary forces, and genetic drift.
* **Human Genetics:** Pedigree analysis and genetic basis of common diseases.

### Methodology
Combines theoretical lectures with problem-solving workshops and laboratory simulations to analyze genetic patterns and molecular data.
