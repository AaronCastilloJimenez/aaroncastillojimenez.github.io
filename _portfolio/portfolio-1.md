title: "Meta-GRN: Diffusion-Coupled Model of Root Epidermis"
excerpt: "A computational framework in Python to simulate the emergence of spatial patterns in Arabidopsis root through the coupling of gene regulatory networks and molecular diffusion."
collection: portfolio

This repository contains the implementation of the **meta-GRN** model described in our 2025 paper (*npj Systems Biology and Applications*). It simulates how lateral inhibition and protein diffusion (CPC and GL3/EGL3) coordinate cell-fate decisions in the *Arabidopsis thaliana* root epidermis.

### Key Features:
* **Hybrid Modeling:** Integrates discrete logical rules (GRN) with reaction-diffusion dynamics.
* **Mutant Simulations:** Includes configurations to replicate wild-type patterns and various mutant phenotypes (cpc, wer, etc.).
* **Spatial Analysis:** Tools to visualize the interspersed "hair" and "non-hair" cell arrangements.

### Technical Stack:
* **Language:** C
