This project, currently under development, provides a specialized workflow for the automated analysis of confocal microscopy stacks in `.nd2` format. The goal is to characterize the cellular geometry and cell cycle dynamics of the *Arabidopsis thaliana* apical meristem.

### Key Features:
* **Multi-Channel Analysis:** Processing of three distinct fluorescent markers:
    * **Cell Wall Marker:** Used for defining cell boundaries and geometry.
    * **Cell Cycle Reporters:** Two markers used to visualize nuclei at different stages of the cell cycle.
* **Deep Learning Integration:** Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust 3D segmentation:
    * **PlantSeg:** Optimized for cell wall-based tissue segmentation.
    * **Cellpose:** Utilized for high-precision nuclear segmentation and tracking.
* **Format Compatibility:** Automated handling and pre-processing of raw Nikon `.nd2` files.

### Technical Stack:
* **Algorithms:** PlantSeg, Cellpose (Convolutional Neural Networks).
* **Tools:** Python, Napari (for proofreading and manual correction), Fiji/ImageJ.
* **Application:** High-throughput characterization of cell geometry and proliferation patterns in the root apical meristem.
