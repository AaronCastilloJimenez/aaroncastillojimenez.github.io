This study integrates experimental data into a Boolean discrete model to explain the regulatory logic of the *Arabidopsis thaliana* cell cycle. We proposed a network that converges into a single robust limit cycle attractor, mimicking the patterns of molecular components observed during the cell cycle phases. The model was validated using loss- and gain-of-function mutants and was further supported by a continuous approximation, ensuring that the results were an emergent consequence of the regulatory logic rather than an artifact of the discrete formalisms. This work provides a theoretical framework to address cell cycle regulation and propose novel predictions in plants and other eukaryotes[cite: 620].
