In this publication, we review the recent advances in computational and mathematical modeling used to study plant development. We emphasize the importance of coupling intracellular gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with supra-cellular physicochemical fields to understand how tissue-level patterns emerge. 

The paper discusses the challenges of modeling across different spatiotemporal scales and highlights how multi-level simulations are essential to identify the dynamical constraints that govern cell-fate decisions in the Arabidopsis root meristem and other plant systems.
