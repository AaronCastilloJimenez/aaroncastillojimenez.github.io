In this study, we provide an improved version of the gene regulatory network (GRN) that determines cell fate in the *Arabidopsis thaliana* root epidermis. By extending our previous models, we integrate more recent experimental data, including redundant bHLH transcription factors and the influence of phytohormones on cell differentiation.

The extended model maintains the robust emergence of trichoblast and atrichoblast steady states while allowing for a more nuanced analysis of how external and internal signals are integrated at the genetic level. This work serves as a comprehensive computational framework for studying developmental robustness and plasticity in plant systems.
