In this study, we propose a systems biology approach to understand how the dynamical feedback between gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and the diffusion of molecular components underlies the emergence of spatial cellular patterns. Using the *Arabidopsis thaliana* root epidermis as a model, we introduce a generalized reaction-diffusion framework that explicitly includes cell-to-cell interaction through lateral inhibition.

Our model integrates the diffusion of CPC and GL3/EGL3 proteins within a meta-GRN, successfully capturing the interspersed hair and non-hair cell patterns in both wild-type and mutant phenotypes. This work overcomes the predictive limitations of previous models by providing a complete GRN topology coupled with explicit diffusion dynamics, offering new insights into the coordination of cell identity in plants.
