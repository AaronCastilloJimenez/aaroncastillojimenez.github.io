👋 Hi! I’m **Aarón Castillo Jiménez**, a researcher in computational biology and systems biology. I specialize in modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and spatial cell patterning in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. My approach combines deterministic and stochastic models of GRNs.

I am currently part of an interdisciplinary project where I develop theoretical models based on experimental data, focusing on the molecular regulation of root epidermis patterning.

My research interests include:

- Developmental Systems biology 
- Computational modeling of Gene Regulatory Networks
- Computational Morphodynamics
- Simulation of spatial patterns and cell differentiation  
- Gene expression data analysis  

📚 You can explore my [publications](/publications/) and view my full [CV](/cv/).
